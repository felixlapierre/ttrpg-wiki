# ttrpg-wiki

A repository to contain wikis for my the tabletop roleplaying games that I run.

There are two wikis at the moment: one for my fantasy world which uses the D&D 5e system, and one for my scifi world which uses the Savage Worlds system.

This repository is published on (Github Pages)[https://felixlapierre.github.io/ttrpg-wiki/]
