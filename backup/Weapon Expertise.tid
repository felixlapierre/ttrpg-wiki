title: Weapon Expertise

You can use the [[Weapon Mastery Properties]] of the weapons you wield. 

When you make an attack, you can spend 1 [[Power]] to apply another weapon's mastery property to the attack, //in addition to the first//. The first time you use this ability after [[Resting|Rest]], it costs no Power.
